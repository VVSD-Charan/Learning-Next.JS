    "content" : "PHP is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Netscape Communications in 1995. It is often used to create interactive web pages and web applications. PHP code can be written directly into HTML pages or stored in a separate PHP file and linked to the HTML file using a script tag. PHP is commonly used to create animations, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle forms, and create dynamic content. It is also used for server-side programming with Node.js and building mobile and desktop applications with frameworks like React Native and Angular.",
