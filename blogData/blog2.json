    "content" : "C++ is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Netscape Communications in 1995. It is often used to create interactive web pages and web applications. C++ code can be written directly into HTML pages or stored in a separate C++ file and linked to the HTML file using a script tag. C++ is commonly used to create animations, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle forms, and create dynamic content. It is also used for server-side programming with Node.js and building mobile and desktop applications with frameworks like React Native and Angular.",
